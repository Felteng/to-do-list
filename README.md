# To-do List
This program functions as a to-do list which the user may manipulate as they see fit. It's stored in an external google sheet so it is mostly limited to personal use as of now.

### The goal
The goal with this project is largely to allow more learning by coding and creating a terminal based application, which can be of use for myself. Furthermore it also provides some grounds to familiarize myself with working with APIs. The source code is also there for anyone who would want to build upon it for their own to-do list application, although I don't suspect there's much appeal to that aspect.
