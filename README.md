# To-do List
This program functions as a to-do list which the user may manipulate as they see fit. It's stored in an external google sheet so it is mostly limited to personal use as of now.

## Planning

### The goal
The goal with this project is largely to allow more learning by coding and creating a terminal based application, which can be of use for myself. Furthermore it also provides some grounds to familiarize myself with working with APIs.
